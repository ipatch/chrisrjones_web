<h1>About Me 🙋</h1>

<p>
  Hello, my name Chris Jones, and and I am 35 year old computer key masher.  I have written an iOS app, <a href="http://github.com/ipatch/kegcop/">KegCop</a>, and am currently maintaining all aspects of this site, ie. CMS dev, hosting, and dev ops.  I have chosen a variety of open source software to maintain the site, and I hope you enjoy your visit.
</p>
<p>
  While working on this site, I also work with a mirage open source software primairly maintained throughout GitHub. You can see what I've been up to <a href="http://github.com/ipatch/">here</a>. Don't be a stranger, and I promise I won't bite.
</p>
<p>
  I also maintain another site, <a href="http://theairportwiki.com">theairportwiki.com</a> which contains information concerning Apple home routers and NAS's, ie Apple Time Capsules and what not.
</p>
<p>
  Frequently check in, to see updates, as the site is a constant work in progress.  Thanks for reading.<br>
  <br>
  cheers 🍻<br>
  Chris
